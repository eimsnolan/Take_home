# Assignment Instructions

Take-home challenge

Intro: When you type a query into a search engine, the page returned to you is called a Search Engine Results Page, or SERP. A SERP generally consists of a list of related searches, ads, and the list of results with their titles, URLs, and descriptions. The HTML for a SERP can be parsed into just the relevant data, and that data can be used for interesting analysis.

Challenge: Included with this challenge is a set of 150 SERPs parsed into JSON. Using data science tools of your choosing, group this set of SERPs into 3 clusters and be prepared to discuss the key features of each cluster. The parameters of this challenge are:

* It should take less than 3 hours to complete
* Please use either Python or Ruby to craft a solution
* Turn in, via Github repository link, Google Drive, or email:
    - The code you created to solve this problem
    - The SERPs clustered into 3 groups (add cluster IDs to the original SERP data provided)
    - Your analysis (including text, figures, plots, etc.) of the key features of each group


## Results
All analysis, figures, conclusions can be found in cluster_analysis.ipynb
The serps with attached cluster_id is under data/serp_cluster_results.csv
